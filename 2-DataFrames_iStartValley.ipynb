    "- Would the campaign be successful?\n",
    "- If the campaign was successful, how much of that success could be attributed to the ads?\n",
    "\n",
    "With the second question in mind, they agreed to run an A/B test. The majority of the people exposed to Rocket Fuel's content delivery network would see TaskBella's handbag ad (the experimental group). But, a small portion of people (the control group) would instead see a Public Service Announcement (PSA) in the exact size and place the ad would normally be.\n",
